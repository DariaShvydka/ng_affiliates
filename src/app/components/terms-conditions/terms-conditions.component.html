            </li>
            <li>8.5. When advertising to customers in Great Britain, you shall abide by the rules for gambling advertising as defined by the Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP and BCAP) and upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority. You will ensure that marketing communications, particularly in relation to free bet and bonus offers do not amount to or involve misleading actions or misleading omissions. Marketing communications that include a promotion must provide as such information about significant conditions as practicable within the advert itself, and with sufficient prominence. Where the advert is genuinely limited by space (banner advertisement) significant conditions must be displayed no further than one click away from the advert itself. Examples of free bet or bonus offers which may not comply with legislation include: the promotion does not provide supporting information on the terms and conditions of the offer or provides it with insufficient prominence for example only visible once scrolled down; when clicked, advertising banners take a customer direct to the join or login section of the website, without providing terms and conditions of the offer; significant information may only be available 'below the fold' on a web page or email and a customer may only be aware that terms and conditions apply if they actively scroll to the end of a webpage or similar. The above requirements are applicable to all forms of marketing communication, including social media and other forms of advertising such as newspapers. We reserve the right to terminate the Agreement if, in our reasonable opinion, you have breached the gambling advertising rules as defined by Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP and BCAP) and upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority.
